Web Transfer Protocol [IN PROGRESS]

   ![Logo WTP](https://static.myrasp.fr/WTP/logo.png)


## What is Web Transfer Protocol ? 

A protocol for decentralized internet, peer-to-peer and open sources in Python  
Web Transfer Protocol is a new Internet protocol that will complement the current Internet for all Internet users who want to contribute to a totally new, secure, untraceable and P2P (peer-to-peer) Internet. You will be able to continue using the current internet, in addition to Web Transfer Protocol. The main goal of WTP is to navigate freely, without geographic, political or other restrictions and to use a new Internet free of ads and silly distractions, to create new things and build a better network together.
  
## How to install it? 

  - WTP is a Python protocol which only uses basic Python modules, and request ('pip3 install request')
  You will only need an up to date Python version and an internet access (Python 3.0 or later)
  
## How to use it? 

  - A wiki is being created, you can see it in the wiki part of the repository

  - For those who wants to test or try it: 
    - Clone the repository;
    - Open the "launcher.py" file with Python;
    - The program then asks you what Port you want to use, you can put whatever you want ( you can just enter 5555);
    - Then the connection with the protocol is established, let the startup.py run and you can open "clientCMD.py" in the same time. Select the same port as "launcher.py".
    You can now run the commands existing to start using the network !
