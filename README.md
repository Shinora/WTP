Web Transfert Protocol [IN PROGRESS]

   ![Logo WTP](https://static.myrasp.fr/WTP/logo.png)


## What is Web Transfert Protocol ? 

  - WTP is a new internet protocol which will be used to replace the actual internet for people who are "anti-GAFAM", 
people who wants to contribute on a completely new, secure and P2P ( Peer to Peer ) Internet. You will be able to keep using internet and WTP. 
The main goal of the WTP is to navigate and use a new internet free from ads and stupid distractions, create new inedite things and build together a better network.
  
  
## How to install it? 

  - WTP is a Python protocol which only uses basic Python modules.
  You will only need an up to date Python version and an internet access.
  
## How to use it? 

  - A tutorial will be released soon when the WTP will be finished. 
   Stay on touch :) 

  - For those who wants to test or try it: 
    - Clone the repository;
    - Open the "launcher.py" file with Python;
    - The program then asks you what Port you want to use, you can put whatever you want ( you can just enter 5555);
    - Then the connection with the protocol is established, let the startup.py run and you can open "clientCMD.py" in the same time. Select the same port as "launcher.py".
    You can now run the commands existing to start using the network !
